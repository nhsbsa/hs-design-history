Providing a better view of the children data while making the process of adding children quicker and easier.

## What are we wanting to improve?
Viewing children details inside of Dynamics is something already available to CCS, at the moment they are only able to view the childs date of birth and the number of children on the claim. We aim to improve this by supplying the childrens full name.

The current process for adding a child to a claim (i.e. baby has just been born), CCS have to go through a referral form process which is completed by CCS and then handed over to the back office, this then goes through a process which can take up to 10 working days, once this part of the process is completed there is then another stage where this can take another 10 working days, making it a total of 20 working days before a beneficiary can be paid their updated amount. 

## What are our user needs?
User research has been conducted on finding out what the needs are from CCS, out of 5 participants we have found that all 5 would like to be able to take more control over the children details by having the option to add a child to the claim. 

Participants have explained the current process they need to follow to do this and for them to have the availability to do this themselves would save themselves time but also the time it takes the beneficiary to receive an updated payment.

## What we have done so far?
Designs are underway for this, on a claim, CSS will be able to see:
* How many children are on the claim
* Each childs full name
* Each childs date of birth

When a claim does not have a child associated to it, or a baby has been born and needs to be added to the claim, CCS will be able to:
* Add a new child to the claim by entering the full name and date of birth

This is the first part of children details being more manageable in dynamics and next we will be looking into:
* Edit child details
* Remove a child
